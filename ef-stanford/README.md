# Stata Code

This directory contains the code to clean, analyze, and produce the output for this project. To run the project from start to finish, simply navigate Stata to this directory and run

``` Stata
run MainSurvey.do
```

This main.do do file consists of two parts, a cleaning section which runs all of the cleaning code and an analysis section which runs all of the analysis code. Both of these rely on the file_header.do file which contains shortcuts for directory and file locations within this project.
